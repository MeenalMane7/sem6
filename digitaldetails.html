having any signage onto it – no 
name, no windows…nothing in particular.
You would expect people may drop in out
of curiosity, looking for product A, 
whereas you are selling product B. Now, 
when you have a shop with a proper name
and probably the product image on it, 
this would attract so many people off 
the street, and they would ask for what 
you sell, and some of these customers 
would tell other potential targets about
their buying experience and about your 
products and your shops.</pre>
